Other Credits
-------------

- The backported ``super()`` and ``range()`` functions are derived from Ryan
  Kelly's ``magicsuper`` module and Dan Crosta's ``xrange`` module.

- The ``futurize`` and ``pasteurize`` scripts use ``lib2to3``, ``lib3to2``, and
  parts of Armin Ronacher's ``python-modernize`` code.

- The ``python_2_unicode_compatible`` decorator is from Django. The
  ``implements_iterator`` and ``with_metaclass`` decorators are from Jinja2.

- The ``exec_`` function and some others in ``future.utils`` are from the
  ``six`` module by Benjamin Peterson.

- The ``raise_`` and ``raise_with_traceback`` functions were contributed by
  Jeff Tratner.

- Documentation is generated with `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`_ using the
  ``sphinx-bootstrap`` theme.

- ``past.translation`` is inspired by and borrows some code from Sanjay Vinip's
  ``uprefix`` module.
